# we create selectors to target/tag a certain element/tag thing 

# but if only write <p> tag Selector it will apply theme to all <p> present , therefore to target specific use Class attribute in html which provides us with a hook for CSS to hook into that and use it as a selector so we can style just that Element with that Class

# Multiple selectors can have same Class name attributes hence same hooks effects of css
